# Massively Parallel Artificial Neural Network

This is an implementation of DNN capable of performing multinomial classifications.
The network was tested on AMOS. Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute's Blue Gene/Q architecture based supercomputer.

Does it work? Yes-ish. There still a lot of work to be done. 
Initital results are discussed in [this paper](https://www.dropbox.com/s/a7djrwximezc952/massively-parallel-deep%20%283%29.pdf?dl=0)
